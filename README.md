# TX-GSC
A GSC helper tool for Treyarch games on the PS4.<br>

## Opcodes
Opcodes can be found in the txt files.<br>
These are dumped from the game at runtime and labeled.<br>

## Notes
I had this project still laying around from when porting BO3/BO4 GSC to PS4.<br>
This has been a while ago and I don't remember every detail.<br>
T9 is only for dumping? maybe??<br>
T9 opcodes are incomplete, T8 db might need a fix after creation.<br>
T7 db needs the "header" from the original db file.<br>
The database created with this tool is the output to be used with [t7-compiler](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7-compiler).<br>
Zero code changes are required for BO4 to compile for PS4.<br>
BO3 just had a check for the database to be serialized with the correct tool or something like that in the version I used in 2021.<br>
This might not even be a thing in the current version of the compiler, BO3 might just work too.<br><br>
People have been selling this for a absurd amount of money, so here you go, enjoy!<br>
This can be very easily injected on testkit/devkit with some modifications to the eboot.<br>
I will be releasing the patches to do so shortly (if I don't forget), don't pay for this stuff!!!
